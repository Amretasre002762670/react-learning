# Custom React Hook: `useLocalStorage`

## Question

Create a custom React hook called `useLocalStorage` that stores and retrieves values from `localStorage`. The hook should:

1. Accept a `key` and an `initial value` as arguments.
2. Store the value in `localStorage`.
3. Update the stored value whenever it changes.

**Follow-up:** How would you modify this hook to support `sessionStorage`?
